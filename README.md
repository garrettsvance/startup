##Elevator Pitch

Managing and maintaining a healthy pool can be exhausting, especially when trying to remember all the different measurements and chemicals that need to be added in order to create a safe and clean environment. Wouldn't it be nice to have all of those calculations done for you? All you would need to do is input your information, and you're immediately told what they all mean, as well as given instructions to fix and adjust the things that need it! Each user would create an account that stores the information regarding their pool. By entering in the PH level readings, chlorine levels, and alkalinity, they'll be provided with helpful links and measurements for adjusting their pool water to be optimal.
